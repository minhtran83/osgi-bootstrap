            <p>Before an app connects to a BlueButton+ provider, it
            registers with that provider as an OAuth2 Client. The
            registration process informs the provider what the app
            is called, where to find it, what permissions it might
            ask patients for, and how to display an authorization
            screen to patients.</p>

            <p>BB+ apps register with providers using <a href=
            "http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg">OAuth2
            Dynamic Client Registration</a>. This guide walks
            through the process of registering a client using open
            registration, as well as an example of using trusted
            registration which leverages BB+ Registries.</p>
            
            <h2 id="client-types">Client Types</h2>
            
            <p>BlueButton+ allows for several different types of clients and use cases that are differentiated along two axes: whether or not a client can reasonably guard its <code>client_secret</code> at runtime, and whether or not it can guard its <code>registration_jwt</code> at runtime (if it has one). The OAuth 2 specification defines the former class distinction as "confidential" and "public" clients, but there is not existing terminology for the latter classification. This combination leads us to a matrix of six possible application styles:</p>

            <p>When deciding whether and how to register with a Registry Service, a client application developer MUST determine which of the above categories are appropriate for their application. Application developers must take care to select the appropriate category for their application based on its runtime capabilites as well as policies around the data. A Registry should help enable these distinctions by explicitly asking application develoeprs about the capabilities of their applications in order to determine which policies to apply.</p>
            
      <h3 id="clients-trusted-confidential"> Trusted Confidential Application</h3>
      
      <h5>Examples:</h5>
      <ul>
      <li>Web application where all API interactions between client and provider happen in the back channel ("server-side, away from the end-user"). This is the recommended mode for web-server based applications.</li>
      <li>Native applications that can be issued a per-instance <code>registration_jwt</code> (using mechanisms outside the scope of this specification)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5>Policies:</h5>
      <ul>
<li>Uses trusted registration</li>
      <li>This is the setup with the highest assurance. Therefore authorization server can present the user with its least-scary authorization screen.</li>
      <li>If the <code>registration_jwt</code> or <code>client_secret</code> are exposed, it should be considered a major security breach and system-wide invalidation of the application's instances (and re-provisioning of its <code>registration_jwt</code>) are reasonable and expected countermeasures.</li>
      </ul>
      
	    <h3 id="clients-trusted-public" > Trusted Public Application</h3>
	    
      <h5>Examples:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Split server-side/in-browser application that handles dynamic registration in the back-end (server-side) but performs authorization in the browser (likely using implicit flow)</li>
	    </ul>
	    
      <h5>Policies:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Uses trusted registration</li>
	    <li>An application MUST pre-register its <code>redirect_uri</code>s at the Registry Service and the authorization server MUST enforce them.</li>
	    <li>On the authorization page, the authorization server should disclose the name and URI of the application for users to confirm that it matches what they think they're using</li>
	    <li>If the <code>registration_jwt</code> is exposed, it should be considered a major security breach and system-wide invalidation of the application's instances (and re-provisioning of its <code>registration_jwt</code>) are reasonable and expected countermeasures.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3 id="clients-semitrusted-confidential" > Semi-Trusted Confidential Application</h3>
      <h5>Examples:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Self-sufficient native applications that register themselves separately per installation instance based on their pre-registered parameters.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
      <h5>Policies:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Uses trusted registration</li>
	    <li>The <code>registration_jwt</code> is packaged in with the application and is therefore available to all end-users. This means that any holder of this JWT could try to register with this application's parameters and it must not be trusted for access without a user's explicit consent.</li>
	    <li>Authorizations servers MUST present users with the name and URI of the application that is being authorized and appropriately caution users.</li>
	    <li>An application MUST pre-register its <code>redirect_uri</code>s at the Registry Service and the authorization server MUST enforce them.</li>
	    <li>An application SHOULD pre-register as many parameters as possible at the Registry Service and the authorization server MUST enforce them.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h3 id="clients-semitrusted-public" > Semi-Trusted Public Application</h3>
      <h5>Examples:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>In-browser javascript applications that handle dynamic registration and authorization (using the implicit flow) on their own</li>
	    </ul>
	    
      <h5>Policies:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Uses trusted registration</li>
	    <li>The <code>registration_jwt</code> is packaged in with the application and is therefore available to all end-users. This means that any holder of this JWT could try to register with this application's parameters and it must not be trusted for access without a user's explicit consent.</li>
	    <li>Authorizations servers MUST present users with the name and URI of the application that is being authorized and appropriately caution users.</li>
	    <li>An application SHOULD pre-register as many parameters as possible at the Registry Service and the authorization server MUST enforce them.</li>
	    <li>This is likely to be a rare case in BB+.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h3 id="clients-experimental-confidential" > Experimental Confidential Application</h3>
      <h5>Examples:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Weekend project / prototype of a web or native client to be used by app developers, their friends, and family</li>
	    </ul>
	    
      <h5>Policies:</h5>
	    <ul>
	    <li>Uses open registration</li>
	    <li>Authorization page MUST display a warning to users that the identity of the application is unverified and MUST state that users should proceed only if they trust the app's presented <code>redirect_uri</code></li>
	    <li>An authorization server MAY display statistics such as how many other users have authorized this application in order to help the user make their decision.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3 id="clients-experimental-public" > Experimental Public Application</h3>
      <h5>Examples:</h5>

            <h2 id="registration-open">Open
            Registration</h2>BlueButton+ providers <strong>must offer</strong> an open
            registration option. To register, an app issues an
            <code>https POST</code> to the registration endpoint,
            supplying registration parameters as a JSON object.

            <div class="well alert-info">
              <strong>Note</strong>: Open registration is
              appropriate for new and experimental apps, but
              patient-facing authorization screens should display a
              warning indicating that an app's identity has not
              been verified. To provide a higher level of
              assurance, apps can perform a Trusted Registration

            <h2 id="registration-trusted">Trusted Registration</h2>

            <p>In addition to open registration, BlueButton+
            providers support a Trusted Registration option. When
            performing a Trusted Registration, apps follow the
            protocol described above, with the addition of a bearer
            token from a BB+ Registry that the provder trusts. This
            trusted bearer token is a <a href=
            "http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token">
            JSON Web Token</a> signed with <a href=
            "http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jones-json-web-signature">
            JSON Web Signature</a> and is verifiable by the service
            provider.</p>

            <div class="well alert-info">
              <h4>Background: Client Classes and Client
              Instances</h4>

              <p>BB+ expects that most apps will connect to
              <em>multiple BB+ providers</em>, and many apps will
              run directly from <em>multiple end-user devices</em>.
              This specification balances a desire for fine-grained
              app registration (e.g. auditing each device's access
              history independently) with a need for
              coarser-grained permissions (e.g. disabling a rogue
              app across all providers, or all devices). We achieve
              this balance by enabling two points of control:
              <em>Client Classes</em> and <em>Client
              Instances</em>.</p>

              <p>As an example to illustrate this distinction,
              let's consider an iOS-based Blood Pressure Grapher.
              This app is considered a "Client Class" because it's
              associated with a single author, homepage, logo,
              Terms of Service agreement, etc. As we'll describe
              below, this class has instances for each BB+ Provider
              the Blood Pressure Grapher registers with, and
              possibly for each device it runs on.</p>

              <p><strong>Client Instances per-Provider</strong> In
              the OAuth sense, the BP Grapher app has a separate
              "instance" for each (app, provider) pair it
              participates in. For example, it will likely use a distinct
              <code>client_id</code> to communicate with each BB+
              provider. (Since <code>client_id</code> is assigned
              by each provider as part of the normal OAuth Dynamic
              Registration process, apps generally <em>will</em>
              have have distinct identifiers for each provider.)
              Still, since these instances all represent "the same
              app", they belong to the same <strong>Client
              Class</strong>.</p>

              <p><strong>Client Instances per-Device</strong>
              Similarly, if the Blood Pressure Grapher is installed
              on multiple iOS devices, it will be assigned a
              separate <code>client_id</code> for each
              (app-on-device, provider) pair it participates in.
              (Since <code>client_id</code> is assigned by each
              provider as part of the normal OAuth Dynamic
              Registration process, apps <em>MUST be assigned</em>
              distinct identifiers per-device by each provider.)
              Again, since these instances all represent "the same
              app," they belong to the same <strong>Client
              Class</strong>.</p>

              <p><strong>Instance- and Class-level
              Controls</strong> In this way, BB+ Providers MUST assign 
              each instance of a Client Class a different
              <code>client_id</code>, as stated in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg">OAuth 2 Dynamic Registration section 5.1</a>. Apps
              MUST simply use the identifiers assigned. No matter which instance
              identifiers are assigned, BB+ Providers maintain the
              ability to make decisions at the Class level, so if
              the Blood Pressure Grapher loses trust, all of its
              instances can be disabled in one fell swoop.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Client Class is manually pre-registered with a
              BB+ Registry.

                <ul>
                  <li>BB+ Registry collects any fixed app
                    <a href="#registration-parameters">registration
                    parameters</a> including, at a minimum,
                    <code>client_name</code> and
                    <code>client_uri</code>
                  </li>

                  <li>BB+ Registry verifies these parameters
                  (according to registry-specific policy)</li>

                  <li>BB+ Registry makes these parameters
                  discoverable via <a href="#discovery-apps">BB+
                  App Discovery</a>
                  </li>

                  <li>BB+ Registry supplies the Client Class with a
                  pre-registration token (signed JWT) for
                  subsequent dynamic registration operations</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Client Instance presents the pre-registration
              token (using an Authorization header or any valid
              mechanism from RFC6750) to the registration endpoint
              of the service provider (which is discoverable via
              the <a href="#discovery-providers">BB+ Provider
              Discovery</a>.
              </li>

              <li>Service provider validates the pre-registration
              token by checking the signature against the public
              key of the BB+ Registry indicated by the
              <code>iss</code> field of the token (and/or doing
              token introspection from the <code>iss</code>).</li>

              <li>Service provider does application discovery based
              on the <code>iss</code> and <code>sub</code> fields
              of the token to find the apps.json entry for this
              application</li>

              <li>Service provider compares any dynamically registered client
              metadata fields to any fixed value fields discovered in apps.json
              </li>

              <li>Client Instance receives a <code>client_id</code>
              and <code>client_secret</code> as well as a
              <code>registration_access_token</code></li>

              <li>Client Instance requests user authorization and
              tokens</li>

              <li>Client Instance accesses protected services at
              service provider</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

            <h3>Pre-registration</h3>

            <p>First, the Client class is manually pre-registered
            with a BB+ Registry. This process may fix any of the
            client parameters listed above, such as the
            <code>client_name</code> and
            <code>redirect_uris</code>. At a minimum,
            <code>client_name</code> and <code>client_uri</code>
            must be fixed at pre-registration time. All classes of
            a client will share any fixed parameters.</p>

            <p>The pre-registered client class will receive:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>a "subject" identifier unique within the scope of
              the BB+ Registry. This "subject" identifer
              <strong>should</strong> be the same as the app's
              homepage (<code>client_uri</code>).</li>

              <li>a signed registration token with the following
              properties:</li>

              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <ul>
                  <li><code>iss</code>: issuer is the URL of the
                  BB+ Registry</li>

                  <li><code>sub</code>: subject is an identifier
                  from the BB+ Registry (as described above)</li>

                  <li><code>iat</code>: timestamp of when this
                  pre-registration information was last updated
                  (and this token was issued)</li>

                  <li><code>exp</code>: OPTIONAL timestamp of when
                  this pre-registration token is no longer
                  valid</li>
                  
                  <li><code>kid</code>: identifier for which key was 
                  used to sign this token at the BB+ Registray</li>

                  <li><em>these claims are combined in a JWT
                  asymmetrically signed by the BB+ Registry.</em></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Registration</h3>

            <p>The registration JWT from the previous step is
            used by instances of the client during the initial call
            to the registration endpoint for each service provider.            
            The service provider now needs to validate the registration
            JWT, compare the client's pre-registered attributes to
            the ones requested dynamically, and proceed with the registration.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a client may send:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
POST /register HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: ey...{JWT token omitted for brevity}...q48d

} 
</pre>

	    <h4>Validating the JWT</h4>            

            <p>All service providers within a BB+ Registry must be
            able to validate the signature and validity of any
            registration tokens. First, the provdier must parse
            the JWT and extract its <code>iss</code> (issuer) field
            and determine if the issuer is trusted. This trust decision
            will generally be a configuration option on the provider, which
            will have a list of Registry Services that it trusts (identified
            by their issuer URLs).</p>
            
            <p>If the <code>iss</code> is from a trusted source, the provider
            then does <a href="#discovery-registry">discovery against the registry</a>
            and finds the <code>jwks_uri</code> of the registry. The provider
            downloads the key set from this URL (using an HTTPS GET request)
            and extracts the key with the <code>kid</code> that is named in the
            JWT. Using that key, the provider can then validate the signature
            of the JWT as described in JSON Web Signatures.</p>
            
            <p class="alert alert-info">It's recommended that
            BB+ Registries publish a <a href=
            "http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richer-oauth-introspection">
            token introspection endpoint</a> to facilitate token
            validation by service providers. In addition to being able to check
            the validity of the signature on a JWT, an introspection
            endpoint can let a service provider determine if a JWT
            is still valid (or has been revoked). 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Validating the Registration</h4>

            <p>The service provider does <a href="#discovery-apps">BB+
            App Discovery</a> based on the <code>sub</code> (subject) and <code>iss</code> (issuer) in
            the registration token to determine which client
            metadata fields have been set ahead of time by the
            pre-registration process. The provider
            MUST abide by and enforce all pre-registered client values.
            The Service provider will
            compare these pre-registered fields with any
            dynamically provided fields and determine the validity
            of the registration. It is RECOMMENDED that providers 
            perform a direct string comparison between pre-registered 
            values and the values provided by the client. If there is a
            mismatch in any field, the provider MUST either return 
            an <code>invalid_client_metadata</code> error (as described
            in OAuth 2 Dynamic Registration) or replace the dynamically
            requested value with the pre-registered value. 
            </p>

            <h4>Completing the Registration</h4>
            
            <p>Once the provider has determined that the client registration
            request is valid, it will generate and issue a unique <code>client_id</code>
            and <code>registration_access_token</code>, and if applicable, a unique <code>client_secret</code>.
            The provider MUST NOT re-use the same <code>client_id</code>, <code>registration_access_token</code>,
            or <code>client_secret</code> for different client instances, even
            if these instances are part of the same client class.</p>
            
            <p>The provider MAY link together different client instances that
            are part of the same Client Class to facilitate logging, auditing,
            and emergency deprovisioning of compromised applications. The
            method for the provider doing this is out of scope of this 
            specification.</p>

                service provider.</li>

                <li>This technique allows service providers to link

                providers are responsible for linking thse client
                instances together if they so desire. A service

            <p>BlueButton+ Pull uses <strong>BB+ Registry
            Servers</strong> to enable discovery of BB+ Providers
            and BB+ Apps. Each BB+ Registry Server exposes a set of
            trusted providers and a set of trusted apps at
            well-known <code>https</code> URLs, using simple
            <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> arrays. In
            the BB+ ecosystem, apps and providers must be
            pre-configured with a BB+ Registry Server (or Servers).
            All discovery endpoints are organized beneath
            <code>.well-known/bb/</code> at the server's root.</p>

            <h5>Why JSON-LD?</h5>

            <div class="well alert-info">
              <p><strong>JSON-LD</strong> provides a nice balance
              between idiomatic JSON and well-structured data
              representations. By combining a JSON payload with a
              JSON-LD context, properties can be expanded to full
              URIs so that data can be mixed and matched with other
              services. For example, the BB+ Provider element below
              can automatically be:</p>

            <p>A BB+ <strong>Provider</strong> is defined as the unique combination of a data service provider (a service that serves the BB+ data API) and an authorization provider (an OAuth2 authorization server and related components).

	   <p>In APIs protected by OAuth 2, the <code>scope</code> mechanism allows the Authorization Server, Client, and Protected Resource to communicate the level of access that the client has been authorized for. These scopes are expressed at different times throughout the process:</p>
	   
	   <ol>
	    <li>At pre-registration with a Registry, an application class may pre-register the set of scopes that its instances will be able to ask for in future steps</li>
	    <li>At registration, a client instance may ask for a set of scopes to be tied to its registration</li>
	    <li>At registration, an authorization server will register a client instance with a set of scopes that the client instance may ask for at the authorization endpoint</li>
	    <li>At authorization, a client may ask for a set of scopes to be tied to the issued token</li>
	    <li>At authorization, an end-user and authorization server will determine which scopes are associated with the issued token</li>
	    <li>At token issuance, a token is associated with a set of authorized scopes expressed in the return from the token endpoint</li>
	    <li>At access time, the protected resource compares the scopes associated with the token to the scopes required to access the data API in question</li>
	   </ol>
	   
     <p>The <code>scope</code> paramter in OAuth 2 is a space-separated list of strings, and the values, syntax, and sematnics of the individual scopes are service specific. In the context of Blue Button+, scopes that are defined by the BB+ Push and Pull protocols. </p>
	   
	   <h2>Structured Scopes</h2>
	   
	   <p>In BB+, structured scopes have two parts: a root scope value and a (potentially empty) parameter value, separated by the colon ":" character. In general, the root scope value is used in the pre-registration and registration steps above (steps 1-3), and the fully-specified scope value (root:parameter) is used in the authorization, token, and access steps above (4-7).  Registration for the root scope value implies permission for the client instance to ask for authorization for any fully parameterized scope based on that root. (Note that as with all OAuth 2 scopes, the permission to ask for authorization in no way guarantees or implies that authorization will be granted.)</p>
	   
	   <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
	    <thead>
	      <tr>
		<th>Root Value</th>
		<th>Parameter</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	      </tr>
	    </thead>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr>
		<td><code>search</code></td>
		<td rowspan="2"><code>patient record pseudo-id</code></td>
    <td rowspan="2">
    
    <p>In the Pull authorization protocol, <code>search:</code> represents access to the BB+ Search endpoint, and <code>summary:</code> represents access to the BB+ Summary endpoint. The scope is parameterized because in some cases the authorizing user may not be the same as the patient (for example, a parent authorizing access to her child's record).  This parameter allows each party to keep track of how access tokens map to individual patients, rather than invidiual authorizing users. An empty parameter value (<code>search:</code> or <code>summary:</code>) represents the common case where a patient is authorizing access to her own record. Non-empty parameter values such as <code>search:123</code> or <code>summary:jane</code> are used when the authorizing user is not the same person as the patient whose record is being accessed.
    </p>

    <p> An authorization server need not understand the value of the parameter in order to let the user grant access, but the resource server MUST understand and enforce the value. At this time, each BB+ Pull authorization MUST be associated with <em>exactly one</em> patient record identifier. In other words, <em>a given access token may only be used to access one patient's data</em>.  In step 5, the authorization server MAY prompt the user to choose a single patient record: for example, by asking the end-user to enter a code directly or choose from a list. The details of how these parameter values are defined and communicated between the protected resource, client, end-user, and authorization server are out of scope for this proposal and often out of band. (For example a pediatrician's office may provide a parent with a print-out including a short code to type in at authorization time for authorizing access to each child's record.)

            initially supported: Implcit Grant (appropriate only
            for public clients) and Authorization Code Grant
            (appropriate for public as well as confidential
            clients).</p>

            <p>Both flows follow the same basic pattern:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>App redirects the browser to a BlueButton+
              Provider's Authorization endpoint</li>

              <li>BB+ Provider authenticates patient and obtains
              authorization</li>

              <li>BB+ Provider redirects control back to App</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Using the BB+ Clinical API</h2>
            To access BlueButton+ Clinical API endpoints, an app:
            <ol>
            <li>Obtains Patient Authorization via <a href="#authorization">BB+ Authorization</a></li>
            <li>Discovers a provider's clinical API endpoints via <a href="#discovery-single-provider">Single-Provider Discovery</a> </li>
            <li>Issues an authenticatd request to the endpoint, supplying its OAuth bearer token</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Discovering endpoint URIs</h3>

            Each BB+ Provider exposes a clinical summary endpoint and a
            document search endpoint.  An app discovers the URLs for these
            endpoints at runtime by performing <a
            href="#discovery-single-provider">Single-Provider Discovery</a>.
            The discovery process results in a JSON-LD object whose <code>bb_api.*</code>
            properties are used for the operations described below.

            <h3>Issuing API calls</h3>

            To issue an authenticated API call, an app requests the BB+
            Clinical API endpoint using the appropriate HTTP method (generally
            <code>GET</code> for read-only operations), including its OAuth
            bearer token using an <code>Authorization</code> header or any valid
            mechanism from RFC6750.

            <h3>Negotiating <code>Content-type</code> of the response</h3>

           An app may include an <code>Accept</code> HTTP header with the
           request.  Apps that are unable to set an <code>Accept</code> header
           may alternatively supply a <code>_format</code> query parameter.
           Valid <code>content-type</code> values are listed for each endpoint below.

            <h2 id="clinical-summary">Clinical Summary</h2>

            <h5>Endpoint URI: <code>bb_api</code>.<code>summary</code></h5>

            The clinical summary endpoint returns the most recently available
            summary document.  By default, BB+ Providers supply a clinical
            summary document in Consolidated CDA XML format.  For convenience,
            other MIME types may be derived from a Consolidated CDA and
            returned to an app.  Providers SHOULD support the following
            formats, all of which can be automatically derived from a C-CDA:

            <table class="table table-striped">

              <tr>
                <th>Accept header</th>
                <th>description</th>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td><code>text/xml</code></td>
                <td>DEFAULT.  A Consolidated CDA in XML.</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td><code>text/plain</code></td>
                <td>A document rendered as a simple text file (as in the VA's "classic" BlueButton implementation.</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td><code>text/html</code></td>
                <td>A document rendered as HTML (as might be obtained by applying a generic stylesheet to a C-CDA).</td>
              </tr>

            </table>

            <h3>Using the summary endpoint</h3>

            <p>To retrieve the most recent clinical summary document, an app
            issues an http <code>GET</code> to the <code>summary</code>
            endpoint, including its bearer token using an Authorization
            header or any valid mechanism from RFC6750.
            </p>

            <h3>Search returns a feed of DocumentReferences</h3>
            
            It's important to keep in mind that the document search endpoint
            does not return document content directly.  Rather, it returns an
            Atom feed (or JSON equivalent) containing document descriptors in
            the form of FHIR's DocumentReference resources.  These resources included
            basic document metadata as well as a URL that can be used to fetch
            a document's contents (see <a href="#api-document-fetch">Document
            Retrieval</a> below.)

          In addition to the search paramters described above, BB+ providers
          support Content-type negotiation to determine the format in which
          results are returned. The following formats are available:

            <h4>Content-type (_format) vs. format</h4>

            Two distinct "format-related" parameters are used at the clinical document search endpoint, and it's important to keep them straight.

            <dl>
            <dt>Accept header (or _format parameter)</dt>
            <dd>Defines the MIME type in which search results are returned.  Remember that search results are returned as a feed of DocumentReference document descriptions, and actual document content is not embedded in this feed. So this parameter simply determines whether the feed is Atom (default) or JSON.</dd>
            <dt>format parameter</dt>
            <dd>Search parameter to filter documents by format (typically <code>text/xml</code>). Note the lack of undescore.</dd>

          <h3>Using the search endpoint</h3>

            <p>To search for relevant documents, an app

            endpoint, including its bearer token using an Authorization

            <p><strong>Note</strong>:  FHIR's <code>DocumentReference</code> document

            <p>In practice, to retrieve actual document contents, app

            <h3>Retrieving an individual document</h3>

            <p> By performing a <a href="#clinical-search">Document Search</a>,
            an app obtains an Atom feed (or JSON equivalent) of
            <code>DocumentReference</code> document descriptors.  To fetch actual
            document contents, the app issues an authenticated,  HTTPS
            <code>GET</code> to dereference the document URI.  This URI is
            available in the <code>./url/@value</code> xpath for an Atom entry,
            or the <code>url</code>.<code>value</code> field of a JSON feed
            entry. </p>

      
          <h4>Example request</h4>
          For the example <a href="#example-documentreference-feed">JSON feed above</a>, an app would fetch actual document contents via:
          <pre>

            <p>Patient data is stored with many providers, and

            OAuth2-based mechanism for creating a BB+ Push
            connection. In orther words, this workflow helps user

            (Direct e-mail messaging).</p>

            <h3>User Authorization Flow:</h3>

            <p>In this section, we describe how a user can
            authorize a service provider to send
            updates as new health data becomes available. To enable
            this process, the client must perform the following
            steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Discovery as described above (<a href=
              "#discovery-providers">provider discovery</a> at its
              BB+ Registry ).
              </li>

              <li>Search, filter, and optionally cache discovered
              service providers. The user will select one or more
              to authorize.</li>

              <li>
                <a href="#registration-trusted">Dynamically
                register</a> if the client doesn't already have
                their OAuth 2 credentials for the chosen service
                provider.
              </li>

              <li>Send the user (in a web browser) to the service
              provider's authorization endpoint. They have the
              option to authorize this provider to push their
              data.</li>

              <li>Verify success by requesting a token from the
              service provider's token endpoint to ensure the
              user's selection succeeded.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

            <h4>1. Discovery</h4>

            <p>Discovery for Push is the same process as shown
            above for <a href="#discovery-providers">provider
            discovery</a>. A provider's information, including
            endpoint URIs, will be served in the following
            format:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "name": "Good Health Clinic",
  "description": "Serving your health needs since 1999",
  "url": "http://goodhealthclinic.org",
  "location": {
    "geo": {                       
      "latitude": 42.3591,            # just making the point that we can
      "longitude": -71.0934           # use arbitrary schema.org properties
    }
  }
}
</pre>

            <h4>2. Search, filter, and cache</h4>

            <p>The specifics of client-side searching, filtering,
            caching, and selecting are out of scope for this guide.
            Part of the rationale for delegating this task to the
            client is that the implementation of these tasks may
            vary by platform</p>

            <h4>3. Dynamic registration</h4>

            <p>Dynamic registration for Push is the same process as
            <a href="#registration-trusted">shown above</a>. This
            step retrieves a client_id and client_secret for this
            specific service provider. These values may and likely
            will vary across providers. If the client has already
            retrieved the client's ID and secret, this step can be
            skipped. Below is an example of the metadata sent in a
            request for dynamic registration and the response
            received.</p>

            <h4>4. Authorization request</h4>

            <p>By this step, the client has its OAuth 2
            credentials. The client will use that data to send the
            user to the service provider's authorization endpoint.
            Below is an example authorization request for the code
            workflow (more information is available in OAuth 2 RFC
            6749 Section 4.1):</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
http://portal.goodhealthclinic.org/authorize?
  response_type=code&amp;
  client_id=bp-grapher-goodhealth&amp;
  redirect_uri=https://bpgrapher.org/after-auth&amp;
  state=aliawejhwiluaq34hiuow&amp;
  scope=send_email_to:oip8erjoiaewjoi@direct.bp-grapher.org
</pre>

            <div class="well alert">
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> The send_email_to scope
              construct above is asking for permission to send
              e-mail to the given address after the :, using a
              simple expression language as part of the structured
              scope.</p>
            </div>

            <p>At this point, the client will receive either a
            positive response or a failure. Hypothetically, this
            response reflects the ultimate results, but the next
            step addresses the client's ability to verify this
            response</p>

            <p>Positive response: Client is redirected to:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
https://bpgrapher.org/after-auth?
  state=aliawejhwiluaq34hiuow&amp;
  code=oafea8i23n
</pre>

            <p>Error response: (e.g. user clicked deny):</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
https://bpgrapher.org/after-auth?
  state=aliawejhwiluaq34hiuow&amp;
  error=access_denied (Other error codes are available from 4.1.2.1)
</pre>

            <h4>5. Verify authorization results</h4>

            <p>To verify that the code we got is real, we request a
            token using the code from the token endpoint. If this
            returns an access token (and not an error), then we
            know the code we used was good and that the user
            actually authorized for us. Optionally, the client
            can also check the scope of the returned token to
            ensure that the requested scopes were received. Below
            is an example of the request for this verification:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
http://portal.goodhealthclinic.org/token
  client_id=bp-grapher-goodhealth&amp;
  client_secret=aser98uw4ijhsdfg9r4&amp;
  redirect_uri=https://bpgrapher.org/after-auth&amp;
  grant_type=code&amp;
  code=oafea8i23n
</pre>

            <p>The server then returns the token structure as
            follows:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "access_token": "i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": "3600",
  "scope": "send_email_to:oip8erjoiaewjoi@direct.bp-grapher.org"
} 
</pre>

          <div class="well alert-info">
            <h3>Alternative Push Authorization Strategy
            <span class="label label-warning">Push</span></h3>An
            alternative to this whole approach would be to have the
            Client be Good Health Clinic and the Provider be
            BP-Grapher, with the protected data being the email
            address to send things to. This is more in line with
            OAuth's REST-friendly model and the traditional
            definition of roles, but it doesn't fit as well with
            the PUSH methods we're trying to enable here.
